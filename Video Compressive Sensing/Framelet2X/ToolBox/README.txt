These MATLAB programs implement an expansive 1-dimensional
energy preserving wavelet transform with the (anti-) symmetric
wavelets developed in the paper,

 I. W. Selesnick and A. Farras Abdelnour,
 Symmetric wavelet tight frames with two generators,
 Applied and Computational Harmonic Analalysis, 
 17(2):211-225, September 2004.
 (Special Issue on Frames in Harmonic Analysis, Part II).

The implementation uses symmetric extension for the boundaries.
See the accompanying PDF document for additional information.

Programs for the implementation of 2-dimensional wavelet
transforms will be available upon request to Ivan Selesnick
(Email: selesi@poly.edu).
